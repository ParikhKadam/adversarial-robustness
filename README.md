## Attack
- [ICLR19][A Frank-Wolfe Framework For Efficient And Effective Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10828) - Jinghui Chen, Jinfeng Yi, Quanquan Gu
## Defense
> Currently, the defenses against the adversarial attacks are being developed along three main directions: 
>   1) Using modified training during learning or modified input during testing. 
>   2) Modifying networks, e.g. by adding more layers/subnetworks, changing loss/activation functions etc.
>   3) Using external models as network add-on when classifying unseen examples.
